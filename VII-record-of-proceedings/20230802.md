[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000]   I opened it and I didn't see your reply. Instead I saw Yamaderson saying thank you for that.

[00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:12.000]   I didn't just go read it, just to check that it was yours actually instead.

[00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:20.000]   Are you at the office right now?

[00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:32.000]   Yes, currently I have a question because Mark gave me the data previously.

[00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:42.000]   And Edward said that he got another version of data which is different from the previous.

[00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:47.000]   So I just want to know which version should I use?

[00:00:49.000 --> 00:01:03.000]   If you can share your screen, maybe it will help me to understand what you are talking about.

[00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:11.000]   I think no, because I am using my phone to talk with you.

[00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:24.000]   But I think that if you have completed this part, can you share the predicted data with me?

[00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:37.000]   So I can reconfirm which one should I use.

[00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:40.000]   Which data?

[00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:45.000]   The predicted data to be used.

[00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:52.000]   So the thing is actually I am the one who is new to the project.

[00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:59.000]   So I have worked on the project for a short time, like one week.

[00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:14.000]   But my work was basically limited to trying or getting an idea of what kind of data we have and what kind of model design we should adopt for that data.

[00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:19.000]   But so far, let me just maybe get an idea.

[00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:26.000]   Let me check the data that Mark has shared with me and then I can also send it to you.

whisper_full_with_state: progress =   5%

[00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:33.000]   But besides that, I know that Mark was actively working on it.

[00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.000]   But that's all I know actually.

[00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:46.000]   I don't know what came after and what were just the troubles that prevented the whole project to not be finished on time.

[00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:55.000]   When I talked to Mark before, he was confident to finish everything on time.

[00:02:55.000 --> 00:03:05.000]   But at the same time, we had a little bit of conflict on how we're going to approach the program and how we will design the model.

[00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:17.000]   And because he was the one actively working on it and back then I didn't have enough time, I let him just do as he understands with the program.

[00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:25.000]   And I was like, if anything else needs to be done, maybe I will just come back later and work on the project.

[00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:33.000]   But back then I remember we were having a different point of view on how we should design the model.

[00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:43.000]   Because to me, the task was kind of like, I think it was just mainly because I didn't understand properly what was the task.

[00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:58.000]   But if I would have just reformat the task or to try to understand how it should be done in a machine learning predictive modeling, it should be done differently.

[00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:06.000]   So I explained to him what I think and how the program should be sold.

[00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:16.000]   But he had a different idea. So because he was the one having enough time to work on it full time, I let him just work as he understands.

[00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:24.000]   But I think in the future, maybe we should just have a different approach.

[00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:29.000]   But so far, I didn't know that even his approach didn't work out.

whisper_full_with_state: progress =  10%

[00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:36.000]   But yeah, I was so surprised when I read your email.

[00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:41.000]   I didn't know anything about just the project and how it works.

[00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:59.000]   I thought that I shared the predicted CSV file with you by Google Drive. So I think you can access this later.

[00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:19.000]   Okay.

[00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:27.000]   So on Google Drive, I do have Supermarket AI data.

[00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:32.000]   I think.

[00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:45.000]   Supermarket AI data. It should be this.

[00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:50.000]   There's a CSV file.

[00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:56.000]   Yes, it is named the predicted CSV.

[00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:58.000]   Okay.

[00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:03.000]   The file name is predicted CSV.

[00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:06.000]   Oh, that's the name of what?

[00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:10.000]   The name of the file.

[00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:18.000]   The one you just sent me, have you predicted CSV? Yes, I received it.

[00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:21.000]   So what is this?

[00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:25.000]   This is the data you received from AI, right?

[00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:27.000]   Yes.

[00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:45.000]   Previously, I...

[00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:49.000]   The X axis is the time series.

[00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:54.000]   And the Y is the sales.

whisper_full_with_state: progress =  15%

[00:06:54.000 --> 00:07:00.000]   Oh, so sales over time. Yes.

[00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:06.000]   Oh, so these are kind of like linear prediction. Okay.

[00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:16.000]   Oh, yeah.

[00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:21.000]   From January to...

[00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:28.000]   So this was a map of prediction.

[00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:33.000]   Okay, so this is all we need to do.

[00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:43.000]   The thing is, I haven't been working on this project, and to be honest, I don't know what is the end goal.

[00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:56.000]   And my question is, actually, Edward got another version of data which is different from this version.

[00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:58.000]   And I...

[00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:09.000]   Apparently, this is not just the raw data. This is a predicted data, which means it appears nowhere else other than what Mark has.

[00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:18.000]   So this was a result of his machine learning models.

[00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:28.000]   So this is... It can't be the same as what, for example, somebody else has, for example.

[00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:32.000]   So it's kind of like very unique.

[00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:35.000]   So let me just maybe go through this.

[00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:39.000]   Are you in the office right now? Yes.

[00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:45.000]   Can we... Could you switch to PC instead?

[00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:49.000]   I can switch to PC.

[00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:52.000]   Okay, just here, please. Okay.

[00:08:52.000 --> 00:09:21.000]   [typing]

whisper_full_with_state: progress =  20%

[00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:48.000]   [typing]

[00:09:48.000 --> 00:10:17.000]   [typing]

[00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:20.000]   Okay, I joined them.

[00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:24.000]   All right. Now I can listen and I need to re-transmit data.

[00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:29.000]   [typing]

[00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:31.000]   Okay.

[00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:34.000]   All right.

[00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:45.000]   Let me share my screen to show you the original data.

[00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:50.000]   So at the beginning, this is the data that... I don't know if you can see my screen.

[00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:53.000]   Yes, I can see your screen.

[00:10:53.000 --> 00:11:00.000]   All right. So this is the raw data that Mark shared with me at the beginning.

[00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:03.000]   So we have a short name here.

[00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:16.000]   We have a timestamp that can be kind of like reformatted to have a time that is, like, what makes sense for us.

[00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:24.000]   This is a receipt ID, and this is the barcode for the product, and this is the name of the product.

whisper_full_with_state: progress =  25%

[00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:40.000]   And the product is in different categories, and we have the quantity of this product on this receipt, and the price as well that was charged for the product.

[00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:43.000]   So we have three different shops.

[00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:49.000]   We have almost, I don't remember how many months, but less than a year.

[00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:53.000]   In the timestamp, we have a ton of receipts.

[00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:59.000]   We have also a ton of barcode, like, items.

[00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:03.000]   But we also have different items names.

[00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:10.000]   Yeah, item names, but also have a bunch of categories in the quantities.

[00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:20.000]   So with this raw data, my first question to Mark was, what is the main goal for this data?

[00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:27.000]   And then the answer that I got was, we need to make a prediction.

[00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:32.000]   And then when he said that, I was like, that doesn't make any sense.

[00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:43.000]   What kind of prediction you want to do? Because you can do a prediction of how many of this product here you want to sell in the next hour.

[00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:47.000]   Or how many of these products you want to sell in a day.

[00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:52.000]   Or how many of these products you need to sell in a week.

[00:12:52.000 --> 00:13:02.000]   Or how many in total, how many items in total you need to sell in a day in the next hour, in a week.

[00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:09.000]   So to me, it wasn't that clear to understand what kind of prediction is needed.

[00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:17.000]   So, and I think he didn't give a clear answer until now, I would say.

[00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:26.000]   Because I was like, okay, if you don't have a clear answer, what I will do, I will try to do what we call an expert data analysis.

[00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:33.000]   At least, try to understand first the data, and in the meantime, try to figure out what is the ultimate goal of this prediction.

[00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:37.000]   Because it doesn't make any sense, we don't know what we want to do.

[00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:46.000]   And at the end, he was thinking that we should just only predict the quantity in the next hour.

whisper_full_with_state: progress =  30%

[00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:59.000]   But at the same time, I told him that's not possible, because we are not having any dependent features or attributes to make prediction over.

[00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:07.000]   So, the only thing we can do is to learn the pattern through the data.

[00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:13.000]   And then through that, we can somehow understand how those patterns are related.

[00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:21.000]   But if possible, if we can add more dependent features, then it might be a prediction that could just make sense at the end.

[00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:35.000]   That's why we came up with adding more data like weather-related data, so that we can know, for example, that if it rains, maybe the sales goes down.

[00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:41.000]   Or if it's a holiday, that also was a data that we added.

[00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:49.000]   If it's a holiday, we just assume that the holiday must have an impact on the sales and so on and so forth.

[00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:59.000]   So, we added the weather-related data, but also we added the holiday dates.

[00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:08.000]   And in addition to that, even if we add those, we need a different approach.

[00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:15.000]   And that's where actually my path and his path were starting, just to kind of put the diversion.

[00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:28.000]   So, my idea was, if we have to do this, we need to think of it as a forecast problem, not just a simple prediction.

[00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:35.000]   Because we're trying to get an idea of how many sales might be needed in the next hour.

[00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:46.000]   That's a forecast, which means all the data have to be connected as time series data, instead of just using a normal model.

[00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:56.000]   Normally, we'll just learn the pattern of the data and we'll just predict based on what has been learned,

[00:15:56.000 --> 00:16:02.000]   while a forecast will take the history to predict the future.

whisper_full_with_state: progress =  35%

[00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:07.000]   Like the next hour based on the last hour's sales.

[00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:13.000]   But that is an approach that Mark didn't agree with.

[00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:20.000]   And I didn't want to force him to do something that he doesn't understand and he doesn't agree.

[00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:25.000]   So, I was like, "Okay, just do what you understand, as you understand."

[00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:35.000]   And in the future, if we really need to make it better, or we need to make it as it should be,

[00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:40.000]   then we'll think about how we can just handle the problem as a forecast problem.

[00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:47.000]   And yes, so from that, I was stepping out of the project somehow, slowly.

[00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:50.000]   So, I don't know what went wrong with that.

[00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:57.000]   So, that's why I was like, "Let me just ask you, and if there's anything I can help with,

[00:16:57.000 --> 00:17:04.000]   then I can probably just be there just to help and complete some work that needs to be done."

[00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:10.000]   So, yeah, I'm sorry I just talked a little bit too much, but I don't know if I gave you enough information

[00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:14.000]   to understand my position in this situation.

[00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:23.000]   Okay, thank you for your explanation, and I think I understand what happened.

[00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:34.000]   And my question is, I actually, as I said, I got two different versions of predicted data.

[00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:42.000]   One is the one I sent you, and the other is what Edward got.

[00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:50.000]   And they are different. I just want to know which version should I use.

[00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:58.000]   You should use. So, what Edward got was also from his own learning, right? Like his prediction, right?

[00:17:58.000 --> 00:18:00.000]   Yes.

[00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:05.000]   And did he predict the same timestamp?

whisper_full_with_state: progress =  40%

[00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:16.000]   Because I think from what you've shared, Mark's prediction starts from January 29th to February 28th.

[00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:19.000]   Ah.

[00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:28.000]   And yeah, that's my first question. Did he predict the same range, or his prediction is a little bit different?

[00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:42.000]   Okay. This issue is actually reported by Edward, but I do not know the details of Edward's data.

[00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:53.000]   Because I shared this version I shared with you to Edward, and Edward still have two different versions of data.

[00:18:53.000 --> 00:18:58.000]   So, Edward doesn't know which one to use.

[00:18:58.000 --> 00:19:03.000]   Okay. May I ask one more question? Who's leading this project?

[00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:07.000]   Victor is the leader of this project.

[00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:12.000]   Yes.

[00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:16.000]   And one more question. Actually...

[00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:20.000]   The question is, I was asking who's leading this project?

[00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:23.000]   Victor is leading this project.

[00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:27.000]   Oh, who is the leader of this project?

[00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:31.000]   Victor is the leader of the project.

[00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:32.000]   Huh?

[00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:36.000]   Victor.

[00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:44.000]   So, I know some people are working on this project, and among those people is you, it was marked as Edward,

[00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:54.000]   but I don't know who is leading, who is taking responsibilities or giving...

[00:19:54.000 --> 00:19:58.000]   I don't know how to explain it.

[00:19:58.000 --> 00:20:01.000]   Victor is the leader of the project?

[00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:05.000]   Yes.

[00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:08.000]   Oh, Victor? Victor is the leader?

[00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:10.000]   Yes, yes.

whisper_full_with_state: progress =  45%

[00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:17.000]   Okay, okay, okay. But, so, did he clear the ultimate goal of this project?

[00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:20.000]   Because I don't really understand what we need to do so far.

[00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:24.000]   I think...

[00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:28.000]   Because that might be the problem.

[00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:36.000]   If the end goal is not clear, then somehow whoever is working on the project will be in trouble,

[00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:43.000]   because we might have different ideas, and we don't know where we're going, kind of.

[00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:48.000]   I understand from your explanation.

[00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:59.000]   Yes, because the reason why, I guess, Mark and Edward are working on the same data but having different outputs

[00:20:59.000 --> 00:21:07.000]   is just because, actually, each of them has his own idea of what the output should be.

[00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:13.000]   So, somehow, there is that miscommunication of what is the end goal.

[00:21:13.000 --> 00:21:22.000]   So, yeah, I guess there's a miscommunication on the project, and that might be just the main problem of the project.

[00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:26.000]   Mm-hmm.

[00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:36.000]   And another question is that the data, the predicted data I shared with you,

[00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:49.000]   actually, when you compare them with the real data, you will find out that they are all below the real data.

[00:21:49.000 --> 00:21:52.000]   That's quite normal, yes.

[00:21:52.000 --> 00:21:55.000]   Does it make sense or not?

[00:21:55.000 --> 00:22:00.000]   Well, it does make sense for so many reasons.

[00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:08.000]   The main reason is the modeling itself.

[00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:12.000]   The second is the data we have.

[00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:22.000]   So, we have data that stretches from, I don't remember actually the date, but it stretches for a few months, I guess.

[00:22:22.000 --> 00:22:25.000]   It's not like even a full year.

[00:22:25.000 --> 00:22:36.000]   As far as I remember, I think there is one season that is missing, and I can probably just go back to evaluate the data,

[00:22:36.000 --> 00:22:38.000]   because I think I have forgotten.

whisper_full_with_state: progress =  50%

[00:22:38.000 --> 00:22:46.000]   So, yeah, if you're taking note, this could just be from the modeling itself.

[00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:51.000]   It could be from the model itself, but also the data.

[00:22:51.000 --> 00:22:57.000]   So, those three things are very important just to have accuracy in the prediction.

[00:22:57.000 --> 00:23:04.000]   So, so far, I guess what Mark has been doing is just to learn actually the pattern of the data,

[00:23:04.000 --> 00:23:10.000]   and once he knows how the data behave, then he can kind of predict.

[00:23:10.000 --> 00:23:18.000]   Not predict, but yeah, try what we like.

[00:23:18.000 --> 00:23:20.000]   How can I say this?

[00:23:20.000 --> 00:23:29.000]   It's not a forecast, but it's a curve that will mimic actually the data.

[00:23:29.000 --> 00:23:37.000]   So, I think that's what he did, but the lack of enough data is also a big problem,

[00:23:37.000 --> 00:23:43.000]   because if you can't have at least a full year, there will always be a gap.

[00:23:43.000 --> 00:23:50.000]   If you want just to make any prediction, the missing data, if it's just from January to March,

[00:23:50.000 --> 00:23:57.000]   then that range won't have any accuracy, because you don't have even like labels for those,

[00:23:57.000 --> 00:24:02.000]   which means you don't have any data that you can just compare a prediction with.

[00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:10.000]   So, even if it's below, like I don't know, but I can just plot actually this to compare with the real data

[00:24:10.000 --> 00:24:19.000]   and see how the curve behaves compared to the real data, but that should be okay as long as there is a correlation.

[00:24:19.000 --> 00:24:27.000]   I don't know if there is a correlation, which means if the curve goes up in the real data and in this prediction,

[00:24:27.000 --> 00:24:35.000]   if it also goes up and if it goes down in the real data and the prediction also goes down, then that should be okay.

[00:24:35.000 --> 00:24:45.000]   But if it's just a random number, then that's not okay at all.

whisper_full_with_state: progress =  55%

[00:24:45.000 --> 00:24:55.000]   So, what I will do is probably I can just plot this data and see how it looks like, kind of.

[00:24:55.000 --> 00:25:04.000]   But in the meantime, I don't know if I should, yeah, I'm going to ask this maybe to Victor about the end goal,

[00:25:04.000 --> 00:25:09.000]   because I don't really understand what you guys are trying to do.

[00:25:09.000 --> 00:25:16.000]   As long as I don't understand what we are going to do with this, there is no way I can come up with any solution.

[00:25:16.000 --> 00:25:21.000]   Yeah, viable solution for this.

[00:25:21.000 --> 00:25:27.000]   Okay, I understand.

[00:25:27.000 --> 00:25:37.000]   So, oh gosh, this week is going to be a little bit busy to me as well.

[00:25:37.000 --> 00:25:46.000]   Well, well, well, well.

[00:25:46.000 --> 00:25:52.000]   Okay, yeah, I will probably contact Victor and ask him about this.

[00:25:52.000 --> 00:25:55.000]   I don't know whether he is going to work out.

[00:25:55.000 --> 00:25:58.000]   I think so.

[00:25:58.000 --> 00:26:08.000]   So far, could you explain to me at least what you are trying to do, what is the main problem so far?

[00:26:08.000 --> 00:26:12.000]   Like what, I stop sharing, I stop sharing.

[00:26:12.000 --> 00:26:20.000]   What is blocking the project?

[00:26:20.000 --> 00:26:33.000]   From my position, as I said, Edward brought two different versions of data.

[00:26:33.000 --> 00:26:50.000]   And I will use this data to reflect them in the front end, so I want to know which one should I use.

[00:26:50.000 --> 00:26:53.000]   So this is my question.

[00:26:53.000 --> 00:26:59.000]   Have you already finished with the design of the front end?

whisper_full_with_state: progress =  60%

[00:26:59.000 --> 00:27:04.000]   Yes, I completed the design of the front end.

[00:27:04.000 --> 00:27:11.000]   So what is missing is just the data, data that can reflect the reality of the prediction, right?

[00:27:11.000 --> 00:27:15.000]   Yes.

[00:27:15.000 --> 00:27:20.000]   So I want to figure out.

[00:27:20.000 --> 00:27:31.000]   Okay, so on the front end, do you have it right now on your computer or on a different one?

[00:27:31.000 --> 00:27:36.000]   Yes, I can share the studio with you.

[00:27:36.000 --> 00:28:05.000]   So you can share the screen just a little bit, at least maybe I will try to understand a little bit.

[00:28:05.000 --> 00:28:07.000]   Okay, thank you.

[00:28:07.000 --> 00:28:12.000]   Okay.

[00:28:12.000 --> 00:28:15.000]   Okay.

[00:28:15.000 --> 00:28:20.000]   Okay.

[00:28:20.000 --> 00:28:23.000]   Okay.

[00:28:23.000 --> 00:28:28.000]   Okay.

[00:28:28.000 --> 00:28:33.000]   Okay.

[00:28:33.000 --> 00:28:36.000]   Okay.

[00:28:36.000 --> 00:28:39.000]   Okay.

[00:28:39.000 --> 00:28:42.000]   Okay.

[00:28:42.000 --> 00:28:45.000]   Okay.

[00:28:45.000 --> 00:28:48.000]   Okay.

[00:28:48.000 --> 00:28:56.000]   Okay.

[00:28:56.000 --> 00:29:25.000]   Yes, I shared the Dodo Data Studio link with you, so I think you can check.

whisper_full_with_state: progress =  65%

[00:29:25.000 --> 00:29:47.000]   Okay.

[00:29:47.000 --> 00:29:49.000]   Okay.

[00:29:49.000 --> 00:30:18.000]   Okay.

[00:30:18.000 --> 00:30:19.000]   Okay.

[00:30:19.000 --> 00:30:22.000]   Okay.

[00:30:22.000 --> 00:30:28.000]   Sales are.

[00:30:28.000 --> 00:30:29.000]   Okay.

[00:30:29.000 --> 00:30:32.000]   Yeah.

[00:30:32.000 --> 00:30:33.000]   Okay.

[00:30:33.000 --> 00:30:35.000]   July 2022.

[00:30:35.000 --> 00:30:54.000]   Okay.

[00:30:54.000 --> 00:31:16.000]   Okay.

whisper_full_with_state: progress =  70%

[00:31:16.000 --> 00:31:17.000]   Yes, yes.

[00:31:18.000 --> 00:31:21.000]   Yes.

[00:31:21.000 --> 00:31:30.000]   Okay.

[00:31:30.000 --> 00:31:36.000]   And I will do the same using the predicted data.

[00:31:36.000 --> 00:31:38.000]   Okay, okay.

[00:31:38.000 --> 00:31:44.000]   But for the predicted data, then that's where actually we need to understand.

[00:31:44.000 --> 00:31:48.000]   So you're going to have a model.

[00:31:48.000 --> 00:31:52.000]   You can't do the same with the predicted data.

[00:31:52.000 --> 00:31:58.000]   The reason why you can't do the same is we need to define a range of the prediction.

[00:31:58.000 --> 00:32:12.000]   You can't just go the same thing because if we if you build a model, it has to have to define, let's say, the range of the prediction.

[00:32:12.000 --> 00:32:16.000]   If it's next hour, next day, next week.

[00:32:16.000 --> 00:32:23.000]   But that range has to be one specific time, like one specific period of time.

[00:32:23.000 --> 00:32:35.000]   And even if you can have something like this, for example, this is the data we have, which is July last year to February of this year.

[00:32:35.000 --> 00:32:44.000]   But the prediction data will probably be, let's say, one month as Mark has already provided data with.

[00:32:44.000 --> 00:32:46.000]   But it's going to be just only one month.

[00:32:46.000 --> 00:32:53.000]   And I don't know if that will be dynamic to be added in case we have more data.

[00:32:53.000 --> 00:32:57.000]   But I'm not sure if it's going to be exactly like this.

[00:32:57.000 --> 00:32:59.000]   So it will be very different.

[00:32:59.000 --> 00:33:06.000]   And we need to decide how it's going to be, I guess.

[00:33:06.000 --> 00:33:08.000]   I understand.

[00:33:08.000 --> 00:33:11.000]   Do you understand what I'm trying to say?

[00:33:11.000 --> 00:33:14.000]   I understand what you are talking about.

[00:33:14.000 --> 00:33:17.000]   OK.

[00:33:17.000 --> 00:33:41.000]   Because we can use, for example, if we want to make a prediction for 2023, from January to February, beginning of 2023 to end of 2023.

whisper_full_with_state: progress =  75%

[00:33:41.000 --> 00:33:46.000]   And then we will have to use all the data we have and try to make a certain prediction.

[00:33:46.000 --> 00:33:48.000]   But it won't be accurate, of course.

[00:33:48.000 --> 00:33:57.000]   But it can reflect what the model has learned, but it won't reflect the reality, which is quite different.

[00:33:57.000 --> 00:34:06.000]   Oh, OK.

[00:34:06.000 --> 00:34:10.000]   It will reflect what the model learned.

[00:34:10.000 --> 00:34:12.000]   Yes, not the reality.

[00:34:12.000 --> 00:34:19.000]   And if the model didn't learn enough, then the prediction also will not perform good enough.

[00:34:19.000 --> 00:34:24.000]   So that's exactly what the prediction actually means.

[00:34:24.000 --> 00:34:27.000]   I understand it.

[00:34:27.000 --> 00:34:30.000]   OK.

[00:34:30.000 --> 00:34:40.000]   But, yeah, this is something that maybe needs to be discussed with the leader of the project and then we can understand what needs to be done.

[00:34:40.000 --> 00:35:01.000]   So far, I think, we can, I don't know if, so like with this front end, do you think that it would be possible to, like in the back end, run a model so that we can dynamically do the prediction, for example?

[00:35:01.000 --> 00:35:14.000]   If you see here, you can just select a date range.

[00:35:14.000 --> 00:35:19.000]   So in here you can select a date range.

[00:35:19.000 --> 00:35:34.000]   If you select a date range, let's see, this is, let's see, it's like this.

[00:35:34.000 --> 00:35:36.000]   This is the beginning, this is the end.

[00:35:36.000 --> 00:36:03.000]   And let's see, like this, and then you apply, what I want just to do is to run a trained model in the background so that it can run the data and dynamically also predict based on this range.

whisper_full_with_state: progress =  80%

[00:36:03.000 --> 00:36:07.000]   So this should be an input of the model.

[00:36:07.000 --> 00:36:28.000]   And once the model has obtained this input, it will use weight that has been learned already to predict any data that comes before this data and use that to fine tune on predicting the output from 19 to 13.

[00:36:28.000 --> 00:36:40.000]   And that should be, to me, it should be the ultimate goal somehow, and that's what we should try to do.

[00:36:40.000 --> 00:36:51.000]   But I don't know if this demo so far can run some background model.

[00:36:51.000 --> 00:36:57.000]   If it's not the case, then we need a different approach.

[00:36:57.000 --> 00:37:11.000]   I think it does not support this feature because the data source should use some spreadsheet or CSV from the Google Drive.

[00:37:11.000 --> 00:37:40.000]   But if you refresh or update the spreadsheet,

[00:37:40.000 --> 00:37:56.000]   the spreadsheet in the Google Drive, the front end will accordingly refresh or update.

[00:37:56.000 --> 00:38:03.000]   If you update the spreadsheet or CSV file.

whisper_full_with_state: progress =  85%

[00:38:03.000 --> 00:38:17.000]   And there is no way we can update.

[00:38:17.000 --> 00:38:20.000]   That could be also not possible.

[00:38:20.000 --> 00:38:24.000]   Like you run some script behind this.

[00:38:24.000 --> 00:38:36.000]   So what you need is just a CSV file with predictions, right?

[00:38:36.000 --> 00:38:37.000]   Yes.

[00:38:37.000 --> 00:38:42.000]   Like a list of predictions in the CSV file table.

[00:38:42.000 --> 00:38:55.000]   Yeah, I think it can be done with the data we have so far.

[00:38:55.000 --> 00:39:11.000]   If Edward says the data is different from his, did he also share his predictions or not yet?

[00:39:11.000 --> 00:39:22.000]   I think Edward templated but didn't share with me right now.

[00:39:22.000 --> 00:39:25.000]   Oh, okay.

[00:39:25.000 --> 00:39:30.000]   Well, in the meantime, I think you can use what Marks gave you.

[00:39:30.000 --> 00:39:42.000]   And if Edward maybe has better predictions, then you can replace his prediction with Edward's.

[00:39:42.000 --> 00:39:52.000]   But yeah, so far, if that's all we need to do is just to upload the CSV file, then actually, okay, I guess.

[00:39:52.000 --> 00:39:55.000]   It doesn't have to be that accurate.

[00:39:55.000 --> 00:40:07.000]   If our ultimate goal is just to upload the predictions.

[00:40:07.000 --> 00:40:12.000]   But we're not doing any future, like, what's the point of just doing this?

[00:40:12.000 --> 00:40:18.000]   Because we will be predicting some data that we already have.

[00:40:18.000 --> 00:40:23.000]   Because we have this data from January to February, we already have that.

[00:40:23.000 --> 00:40:26.000]   So we are not doing anything useful at the end.

whisper_full_with_state: progress =  90%

[00:40:26.000 --> 00:40:37.000]   But at least we are kind of showing that it could be possible to do a prediction of the future.

[00:40:37.000 --> 00:40:43.000]   To me, that's why I keep saying that forecasts should be the way to go.

[00:40:43.000 --> 00:41:02.000]   And instead of just using the linear prediction, because the linear prediction that is used by Mark is not really doing anything other than just learning the curve of the data.

[00:41:02.000 --> 00:41:12.000]   Learning just a pattern within the data without having any output is kind of like useless for the future.

[00:41:12.000 --> 00:41:26.000]   Yeah, in the future, we should just learn how to do forecasts, using the data we have already to predict a data that has never been seen or collected.

[00:41:26.000 --> 00:41:42.000]   Because I guess that's what the supermarkets want to do. They want to know how they can estimate the needs in the future, in the week.

[00:41:42.000 --> 00:41:46.000]   So that they know, or they can just help them do some buy-change.

[00:41:46.000 --> 00:41:53.000]   Instead of ordering too many items or ordering less items than they needed, what do I need?

[00:41:53.000 --> 00:42:02.000]   It's better to just optimize in the supply chain system.

[00:42:02.000 --> 00:42:08.000]   That's what I think. I'm not sure what they want to do with this, but I guess that's what they want to do at least.

[00:42:08.000 --> 00:42:14.000]   I think I have the same question with you.

[00:42:14.000 --> 00:42:23.000]   I'm not sure, but yes, I have the same question with you.

[00:42:23.000 --> 00:42:35.000]   Is it some possibility they want to see the demo and just verify the model?

whisper_full_with_state: progress =  95%

[00:42:35.000 --> 00:42:43.000]   That's what I'm saying. There's a miscommunication from the leader to the engineers who are working on the project.

[00:42:43.000 --> 00:42:53.000]   This should have been briefed in detail so that everyone knows why we're doing this and what is the ultimate goal.

[00:42:53.000 --> 00:42:58.000]   Because if we don't understand where we're going, then somehow we don't know what to do.

[00:42:58.000 --> 00:43:10.000]   That's why I'm just saying I will probably contact Victor to ask him about this and also talk a little bit about how we can fix this before the end of this week.

[00:43:10.000 --> 00:43:18.000]   I think I understand what you are talking about.

[00:43:18.000 --> 00:43:28.000]   I will try to contact Edward to see which one I should use.

[00:43:28.000 --> 00:43:31.000]   Which one? Yes.

[00:43:31.000 --> 00:43:35.000]   I think that's all for it.

[00:43:35.000 --> 00:43:39.000]   Yes, because it took so much of your time.

[00:43:39.000 --> 00:43:47.000]   I will let you know once I talk to Victor. I will contact you back and I will give you some feedback as well.

[00:43:47.000 --> 00:43:49.000]   Thank you very much.

[00:43:49.000 --> 00:43:59.000]   In the meantime, I will see if there's anything I can do to help out.

[00:43:59.000 --> 00:44:12.000]   In the meantime, if there's nothing else I can do, I think I'll just use either RAS data or EWAR, whichever seems to be more reasonable so far.

[00:44:12.000 --> 00:44:17.000]   Okay. Thank you.

[00:44:17.000 --> 00:44:20.000]   Thank you so much. Thanks to you.

[00:44:20.000 --> 00:44:22.000]   Thank you very much.

[00:44:22.000 --> 00:44:24.000]   Have a nice day.

[00:44:24.000 --> 00:44:27.000]   Okay. Have a nice day. Bye.

[00:44:27.000 --> 00:44:29.000]   You too. Bye.

[00:44:29.000 --> 00:44:35.000]   [END]
