API Prototyping on AWS Appsync: Developing an API prototype on AWS AppSync. This service allowed us to build a complex, real-time, and offline-ready API for our Android application in a streamlined and efficient manner. The prototyping phase was essential to understand how our desired API should interact with the application and data sources.
Testing using AppSync Konsole: In addition to the prototyping process, preliminary tests were carried out using the AppSync Konsole. This testing platform helped verify the integrity and functionality of the prototype API, ensuring it meets our application's requirements. While testing, it provided a better understanding of how to troubleshoot and optimize our API for performance improvements.
