1. Handling a data error in SupermarketAI. I began the day by addressing an issue with our SupermarketAI system. There appeared to be a data error on the prediction page, which could have potentially impacted our delivery. To address this, I initiated a communication with Cherubin, who is known for their adeptness in such issues. We worked in collaboration, inspecting the potential sources of these discrepancies and determining the corrective measures needed. Further actions and solutions will be followed up on based on Cherubin's analysis and insights, ensuring the problem is fully resolved with minimal disruption to our delivery.
2. Preparing for the upcoming study session. Recognizing the importance of consistent knowledge enhancement, I dedicated considerable time and effort into understanding the topic at hand and devising an effective learning plan. Further details about the session's content will be presented as we approach the day of the session.
3. Weekly reports were also produced to track and monitor the progress of our tasks and projects. This facilitated a comprehensive overview of our ongoing operations and allowed us to stay updated with our workflow efficiently.
