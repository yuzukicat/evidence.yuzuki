Here is the summary of the key activities accomplished this week:
1. Successfully collaborated with Cherubin on the Look Studio project and confirmed the final work. This validated the ownership change from Cherubin.
2. Implemented the necessary data updates. Shared the Google Data Studio access with our robot account.
3. Managed and oversaw the report development, which involved integrating and preparing the work contributed by Cherubin in readiness for the meeting.
4. Set up the meeting and received feedback from Yamadera San. While Cherubin's contributions were lauded, concerns were raised about my visibility in the project. I was also informed about communication issues potentially causing the project's delay.
5. Acted on the instructions from Yamadera San, which involved meeting set-up, deletions of the test page, and subsequent sharing of the link. The Look Studio was also re-shared as per Yamadera San's request.
6. Communicated a data error on the prediction page to Cherubin and dawaiting further instructions from Yamadera San.
7. begun preparations for the study session scheduled for next week.
Kindly let me know if there are any specific areas that you'd like me to elaborate more on or focus on for the forthcoming week.
