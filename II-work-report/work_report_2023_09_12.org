1. Had a productive meeting with Mr/Ms. Tang concerning the Android application related to our project. Our primary focus was the data syncing feature, which remains a critical function in our app development. We discussed potential strategies and solutions to ensure data consistency processing, which are imperative for a seamless user experience. I am confident that the insights drawn from this discussion will contribute significantly to refining our application.
2. Intensive effort has been put into the database prototyping and architecture design for the project's back-end. This has involved detailing out the database schema, determining the efficient storage and retrieval mechanisms, and ensuring the robustness of our architecture to handle potential scalability and security issues. This groundwork is providing a stable base on which our project can successfully build.
