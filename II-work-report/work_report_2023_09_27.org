1. PD - Android application development project, particularly focused on the user authentication (Auth) backend API.
Integrating and testing Amazon Web Services (AWS) Cognito as our authentication backend. AWS Cognito's robust security functionalities are a promising asset, providing an enriched layer of security to our mobile application, especially in terms of user registration, sign-in, and sign-out routines.
We are presently testing key user authentication functions, namely, the sign-in and sign-out processes. These tests are fundamental to ensuring the seamless operation of these features and are a pivotal part of our timeline. A successful testing phase will help maintain the application's integrity and safeguard user data, which aligns with our team's goal and the company's broader objective of prioritizing data security.
2. Collaboration & Information Exchange:
Productive information exchange with Tang, specifically discussing the database backend specifications and roadmaps. Details of these conversations will be shared separately.
3. Accountability Concern:
On a separate note, there was a situation where I was asked to assume responsibility for an issue I believe fell outside my remit. While I am fully committed to addressing any problems within my scope, it would be helpful to clarify the project's boundaries and individual responsibilities moving forward.
