Osaka University Project:
1. Docker Environment Setup and Testing for PHP:
Setting up a Docker environment for our PHP projects. During the process, I thoroughly tested the environment to identify and resolve any potential issues. Critical to this was the debugging phase, where I addressed an array of complications to ensure a smooth operational context for our PHP developers. Moreover, I pivoted to the task of writing the Dockerfile which sets the baseline for our application's functional and operational requirements. Collectively, these undertakings will facilitate a more efficient, streamlined production workflow.
2. Docker Readme Documentation:
In parallel with the technical work, I have focused on enhancing our Docker Readme documentation. The objective here was to provide clear, understandable, and practical instructions to guide users, particularly those new to Docker. The updates made will help mitigate any potential challenges encountered during the process of Docker environment setup and subsequent utilization.
