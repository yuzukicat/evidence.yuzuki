Yamadera San and I recently reviewed the Google Data Studio owned by me and noticed that the first chart on the MD page still appears to be displaying an error, which weâ€™d like your assistance with. We would greatly appreciate if you could help investigate the nature of this error and provide a fix for it at the earliest.

In addition, there is a new UI request from Yamadera San to change the color scheme of the pages. He has requested that the current black background be replaced with white, and the white letters in turn be changed to black.

I used this color scheme template previously purchased by Yamameda San which is of light theme (blue && white). However, I am unsure how to enact the request mentioned and require your expertise to assist me in updating it.

Could you please confirm whether you will be able to assist in these tasks? If so, do you have a tentative schedule for when they can be completed? Timely resolution of both these requests is crucial, so your prompt attention would be greatly appreciated.

Thank you for your ongoing support and I look forward to hearing from you.
