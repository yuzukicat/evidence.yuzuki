Dear Cherubin,

Thank you for your email and for entrusting me with the final Looker Studio report.

I appreciate your detailed instructions on this. I've confirmed your changed ownership in my account, and the addition of the Robot account as well. I'm prepared to oversee and manage the report from here.

I understand the remaining task involves eliminating some unused data sources, which is not urgent. Thus, I'll address it when time allows.

Moreover, I will wait for further instructions from Yamadera-san and will act accordingly once I receive them next week.

If I have any queries or concerns, I will not hesitate to reach out to you on Discord or Email on either Monday or Tuesday.

Thank you once again for the smooth transition of the report to my responsibility. I hope you also have a pleasant weekend.

Best Regards
