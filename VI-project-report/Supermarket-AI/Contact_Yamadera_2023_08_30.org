Dear Yamadera-san,

I am writing to inform you that the test page and the development page, otherwise referred to as the 'deleted page', have been deleted in accordance with your feature request.

I shared the link directly after completing the feature in an email sent yesterday, but I understand you are incredibly busy, which is why I am also sharing it here on Discord as your request: [https://lookerstudio.google.com/u/0/reporting/6eabf5e5-c395-4be9-9ee3-52fa7eb5e44c](https://lookerstudio.google.com/u/0/reporting/6eabf5e5-c395-4be9-9ee3-52fa7eb5e44c)

As Yamadera san said "by e-mail" during our pervious meeting. I shared it by e-mail yesterday and sent it again here by discord message. I hope this makes it easier for you to review the work at a time that suits you best.

Thank you for your understanding.

Best regards.
