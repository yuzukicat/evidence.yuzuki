Dear Yamadera-san,

Thank you for your message and invaluable advice. I apologize for any distractions or misunderstandings that may have arisen. I assure you that I take your comments seriously and will strive to enhance my approach to our shared responsibilities.

In regards to the technical revisions, I have noted the errors in Md, as well as the required color changes to our pages. These actions are underway and will be swiftly rectified. 

As for your suggestion to learn and share new technology during idle times, it is a wonderful idea that I will implement immediately. I believe this will not only keep me engaged but also contribute positively to the team.

Regarding your insights on teamwork and maintaining a healthy work environment, I appreciate your perspective. From this point forward, I commit to taking on a more self-reflective approach instead of shifting blame. To facilitate smooth teamwork, I agree that setting clear goals, frequent communication, and establishing deadlines are necessary. I am learning from this experience and pledge to improve.

Moving forward, I will ensure my actions and attitude align better with our team dynamics and the project's overall success. 

Thank you for your guidance and assistance.
