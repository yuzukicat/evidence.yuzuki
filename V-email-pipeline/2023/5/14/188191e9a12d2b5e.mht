Subject: Update on Quick Demo Schedule and Request for Clarification on
Requirements

Dear Victor, Mark and Yamadera-san,

I hope this email finds you well. I wanted to provide you with an update on
the quick demo requirement. Unfortunately, I will not be able to complete
it by Monday as your hope, since I have been asked to take a holiday on
Friday and will resume work on Monday.

However, if it is crucial for you to have the demo by Monday, I am willing
to work overtime including today from 18:00--23:00 and Monday 09:00--23:00
to ensure it is delivered on time. Please let me know if this is necessary,
and I will do my best to accommodate your needs.

Additionally, I would like to request further clarification on the specific
requirements of the project. As you may be aware, data science involves
various aspects, and there is a significant difference between data
virtualization and data visualization with notation. These two concepts
require different approaches, timeframes, and solutions.

To better understand your needs and deliver a suitable demo, I kindly ask
that you provide a clear definition of your requirements, rather than
screenshots from Google searches. This will enable me to tailor the demo to
your exact needs and expectations.

Thank you for your attention to this matter, and I look forward to
receiving your feedback on both the timeline and the project requirements.

Best regards,

Yuzuki
