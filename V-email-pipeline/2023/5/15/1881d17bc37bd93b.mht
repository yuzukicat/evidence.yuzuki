Subject: Machine Learning Project: Tool Suggestions and Next Steps

Dear Victor and Yamadera-san,

I hope this email finds you both well. I have received Victor's reply
regarding the machine learning project and the expectations for visualizing
hourly and daily sales for customers. Based on the information provided, I
have researched and identified several tools that could be suitable for our
project:

1. Apache Echarts: https://github.com/apache/echarts
2. React Rcharts: https://github.com/recharts/recharts
3. Chart.js: https://www.chartjs.org/
4. Tableau (not free): https://www.tableau.com/

These tools are data visualization front-end solutions that fit our task
and are easier to customize than PaaS or SaaS. However, as a back-end
engineer, I would like to emphasize that directly connecting to CSV files
might not be the most efficient solution. Instead, I suggest importing data
from CSV files into a database like MySQL or PostgreSQL and then providing
an API for the front-end to consume.

As for the front-end design, I can develop a simple demo to showcase the
functionality to our customers, but I believe that refining the visual
aspects should be done in collaboration with our customers to ensure their
preferences are met, and work with designers && front-end engineers to
customize the view layer of data virtulation.

Moving forward, I will study the documentation and templates for the
suggested tools and learn how to customize them to achieve our goal. I will
also explore how to change the data sources and determine the appropriate
data format.

I am eager to apply my creativity and engineering skills to this project
and will keep you both updated on my progress. If you have any further
suggestions or guidance, please do not hesitate to share. And wait for your
reply to have a scheduled meeting including Yamadara san maybe together to
review the current status.

Best regards,

Yuzuki

Questions and Clarifications on Supermarket AI Task<br><br>Dear Yamadera sa=
n, Victor, and Mark:<br><br>I hope this email finds you well. Thank you for=
 providing me with the information about the project. Before diving into th=
e task, I have a few questions and concerns that I would like to discuss wi=
th you to ensure I have a clear understanding of the project requirements a=
nd my role in it.<br><br>1. Is using Google Data Studio a mandatory require=
ment from our customers or Yamadera-san? I have no experience with this pro=
duct, but I do have experience with similar products from AWS. If the feasi=
bility of Looker Studio has already been tested, I believe it should be fin=
e. However, as you know, some SaaS or PaaS products can be challenging to c=
ustomize.<br><br>2. I am currently unsure about the overall architecture of=
 the project and my role in the pipeline. From my understanding, there are =
some well-established patterns for implementing ML in a product, and our pr=
oject seems to fit some of them. It would be helpful to have more informati=
on on this aspect.<br><br>3. I am still unclear about the expected input an=
d output for my part of the project. Will I be given raw data (which means =
I would need to perform data cleaning), or will I receive serialized data (=
which means I would be responsible for data visualization)? I would appreci=
ate some clarification on this.<br><br>4. Lastly, I would like to share som=
e articles from my blog to give you an idea of my technical background, wha=
t I know, and what I don&#39;t know. This will help ensure that the project=
 is delivered to our customers on time and with high quality.<br><br><a hre=
