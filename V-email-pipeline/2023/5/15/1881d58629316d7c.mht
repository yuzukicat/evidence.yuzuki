Subject: Machine Learning Project: Clarifications and Next Steps

Dear Yamadera-san and Victor,

Thank you for the detailed information regarding the machine learning
project and the client's requirements. I appreciate the guidance and
support provided. Before proceeding, I would like to reconfirm a few points
to ensure that I have a clear understanding of my role and responsibilities
in this project.

1. The client prefers to use Google Data Studio for visualization. I
understand that if we encounter any limitations during the project, we are
not responsible, as we are following the client's instructions.

2. The AI prediction for overlaying daily sales at specific times (e.g.,
12, 15, 17) will be handled by Mark, not me. I will be responsible for
visualizing the data provided by Mark, which should be in CSV format.

3. The selection of days with no significant incidents to show the
difference between AI predictions and real results will also be provided by
Mark. My responsibility is to present the view of the CSV data or results.

4. The same applies to the daily sales predictions for the three stores. I
will be responsible for data visualization, but the data should be
predicted by Mark first, or I will need some data examples.

5. I think we should not rely too heavily on part-timers. Especially, Zhao
has weak technical skills around this (her study is security...), and
Edward, as you may already know, is hard to communicate with (maybe harder
than me lol). And other part-timers you suggested are assigned with other
tasks (in RDS project or PD project). However, I would appreciate Victor's
assistance in coordinating the team, as he is the leader of the machine
learning team, and I am not good at team management && project management.

6. I will require one week to learn how to use Google Data Studio and
discuss the project details and collaborators during this time.

7. I am concerned about the possibility that the solution has not undergone
a feasibility study or testing process, and whether the risk and schedule
might be underestimated.

Moving forward, I will begin learning Google Data Studio and collaborating
with the team members assigned to this project. If you have any further
suggestions, guidance, or clarifications, please do not hesitate to share.

Thank you for your understanding and support.

Best regards,

Yuzuki

Google Data Studio a mandatory requirement from our customers or Yamadera-s=

imilar products from AWS. If the feasibility of Looker Studio has already b=

 PaaS products can be challenging to customize.<br><br>2. I am currently un=
sure about the overall architecture of the project and my role in the pipel=

plementing ML in a product, and our project seems to fit some of them. It w=
ould be helpful to have more information on this aspect.<br><br>3. I am sti=
ll unclear about the expected input and output for my part of the project. =
Will I be given raw data (which means I would need to perform data cleaning=
), or will I receive serialized data (which means I would be responsible fo=
r data visualization)? I would appreciate some clarification on this.<br><b=
r>4. Lastly, I would like to share some articles from my blog to give you a=
n idea of my technical background, what I know, and what I don&#39;t know. =
