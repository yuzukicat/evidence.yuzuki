Dear Yamadera san:

I hope this email finds you well. I am writing to inquire about the
schedule of Yamadera san, as there are some important details regarding the
user scenario, budget, and deadline that need to be confirmed with you. As
you are very busy and can be impatient at times, and unfortunately,
expressed some complain which not helpful to solve our difficulty.

During our recent conversation, Yamadera san mentioned that you cannot make
a decision on these matters today and that they need to be discussed with
other engineers. But you do not care about the deadline, as we have already
lated. Specifically, we need to discuss the options for the architecture of
the project, as every solution depends on the user scenario, budget, and
deadline. For example, we need to determine whether we need cache services
or queue services to handle unexpected usage.

I understand that Yamadera san is the boss and owner of the company, and
therefore, the information we need should be provided by you. As an
engineer, I can provide the best solutions based on the expected user
scenario, budget, and deadline, but without clear definitions of these
factors, I cannot proceed with further tasks.

I would greatly appreciate it if you could let me know your schedule so
that we can arrange a time to discuss these important details. Time is of
the essence, and I hope to receive a response from you as soon as possible.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Best regards.
