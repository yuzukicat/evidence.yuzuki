I hope this email finds you well.

Yuzuki was asked by Yamadera san, to contact you regarding the supermarket
AI project.

However, I must admit that I know very little about the project, including
what my role is or how I can contribute to it.

I was wondering if you could provide me with some information about the
project, such as any documents or resources that I should read or any
preparation or code reading that I should do. I want to make sure that I am
fully prepared to contribute to the project in any way possible.

Additionally, if you have any questions for me, please do not hesitate to
ask. Like my technical background (or stack).

I am eager to learn more about the project and to work with you and your
team to ensure its success.

Thank you for your time and consideration. I look forward to hearing back
from you soon.

Best regards.

Yuzuki
