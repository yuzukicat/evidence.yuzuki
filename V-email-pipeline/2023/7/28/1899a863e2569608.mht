* Clarification and Update on the Supermarket AI Project 2023-07-28

Dear Yamadera san

I understand your concern regarding the progress of the Supermarket AI project, and I appreciate the opportunity to shed light on the situation.

I'd like to clarify the roles and responsibilities within the project, as it seems there may be some misunderstandings. Although I've been deeply involved in the project, my scope of work is primarily focused on the frontend interfaces. I'm pleased to report I completed my tasks before our initial deadline and have been ready to integrate them with the the project's ai predicted data since then.

The delay, unfortunately, stems from aspects outside of my control, specifically the machine learning model training, predicted data, should managed by Victor's team. The project is an interlinked ecosystem of efforts, and without the completion of the data prediction from machine learning team, proceeding with the next steps was not feasible, hence the delay.

Recently, I received the predicted data from the Machine Learning team. However, there seem to be some inaccuracies, with the predictions consistently falling below actual levels. As these predictions play a critical role in the seamless operation of our interfaces, it is crucial that these inaccuracies are addressed by the respective team. I've reached out to Victor to query about this and am awaiting their response and rectification.

Please rest assured that despite this hiccup, I am committed to ensuring the successful completion of the Supermarket AI project. I am consistently liaising with Victor's team to expedite the resolution of the current issues and to proceed with the project as swiftly as possible once these are addressed. My objective, as always, is to uphold the quality and timeliness of our work.

I hope this brings clarity to the situation and welcome any further inquiries.

Best regards,

Yuzuki
