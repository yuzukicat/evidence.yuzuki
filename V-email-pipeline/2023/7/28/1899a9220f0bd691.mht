* Clarification and Update on the Supermarket AI Project 2023-07-28

Dear Yamadera san

I understand your concern regarding *the progress of the Supermarket AI
project*, and I appreciate the opportunity to shed light on the situation.

I'd like to clarify the *roles and responsibilities* within the project, as
it seems there may be some *misunderstandings*. Although I've been deeply
involved in the project, my scope of work is primarily focused on *the
frontend interfaces*. I'm pleased to report I completed my tasks before our
initial deadline and have been *ready to integrate them with the the
project's ai predicted data* since then.

The delay, unfortunately, stems from aspects outside of my control,
specifically the machine learning model training, predicted data, should
managed by Victor's team. The project is an interlinked ecosystem of
efforts, and without the completion of the data prediction from machine
learning team, proceeding with the next steps was not feasible, hence the
delay.

Recently, I *received the predicted data from the Machine Learning team*.
However, there seem to be some inaccuracies, with *the predictions
consistently falling below actual levels*. As these predictions play a
critical role in the seamless operation of our interfaces, it is crucial
that these inaccuracies are addressed by the respective team. *I've reached
out to Mark to query about this and am awaiting their response and
rectification*.

Please rest assured that despite this hiccup, I am committed to ensuring
the successful completion of the Supermarket AI project. I am consistently
liaising with Victor's team to expedite the resolution of the current
issues and to proceed with the project as swiftly as possible once these
are addressed. My objective, as always, is to uphold the quality and
timeliness of our work.

I hope this brings clarity to the situation and welcome any further
inquiries.

Best regards,

Yuzuki
