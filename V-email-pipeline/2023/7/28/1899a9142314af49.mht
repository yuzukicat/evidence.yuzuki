* Clarification and Update on the Supermarket AI Project 2023-07-28

Dear Yamadera san

I understand your concern regarding *the progress of the Supermarket AI 
project*, and I appreciate the opportunity to shed light on the situation.

I'd like to clarify the *roles and responsibilities* within the project, 
as it seems there may be some *misunderstandings*. Although I've been 
deeply involved in the project, my scope of work is primarily focused on 
*the frontend interfaces*. I'm pleased to report I completed my tasks 
before our initial deadline and have been *ready to integrate them with 
the the project's ai predicted data* since then.

The delay, unfortunately, stems from aspects outside of my control, 
specifically the machine learning model training, predicted data, should 
managed by Victor's team. The project is an interlinked ecosystem of 
efforts, and without the completion of the data prediction from machine 
learning team, proceeding with the next steps was not feasible, hence 
the delay.

Recently, I *received the predicted data from the Machine Learning 
team*. However, there seem to be some inaccuracies, with *the 
predictions consistently falling below actual levels*. As these 
predictions play a critical role in the seamless operation of our 
interfaces, it is crucial that these inaccuracies are addressed by the 
respective team. *I've reached out to Mark to query about this and am 
awaiting their response and rectification*.

Please rest assured that despite this hiccup, I am committed to ensuring 
the successful completion of the Supermarket AI project. I am 
consistently liaising with Victor's team to expedite the resolution of 
the current issues and to proceed with the project as swiftly as 
possible once these are addressed. My objective, as always, is to uphold 
the quality and timeliness of our work.

I hope this brings clarity to the situation and welcome any further 
inquiries.

Best regards,

Yuzuki
