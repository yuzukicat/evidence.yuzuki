                    Project 2023-07-28<br>
                    <br>
                    Dear Yamadera san<br>
                    <br>
                    I understand your concern regarding <b>the progress
                      of the Supermarket AI project</b>, and I
                    appreciate the opportunity to shed light on the
                    situation.<br>
                    <br>
                    I'd like to clarify the <b>roles and
                      responsibilities</b> within the project, as it
                    seems there may be some <b>misunderstandings</b>.
                    Although I've been deeply involved in the project,
                    my scope of work is primarily focused on <b>the
                      frontend interfaces</b>. I'm pleased to report I
                    completed my tasks before our initial deadline and
                    have been <b>ready to integrate them with the the
                      project's ai predicted data</b> since then.<br>
                    <br>
                    The delay, unfortunately, stems from aspects outside
                    of my control, specifically the machine learning
                    model training, predicted data, should managed by
                    Victor's team. The project is an interlinked
                    ecosystem of efforts, and without the completion of
                    the data prediction from machine learning team,
                    proceeding with the next steps was not feasible,
                    hence the delay.<br>
                    <br>
                    Recently, I <b>received the predicted data from the
                      Machine Learning team</b>. However, there seem to
                    be some inaccuracies, with <b>the predictions
                      consistently falling below actual levels</b>. As
                    these predictions play a critical role in the
                    seamless operation of our interfaces, it is crucial
                    that these inaccuracies are addressed by the
                    respective team. <b>I've reached out to Mark to
                      query about this and am awaiting their response
                      and rectification</b>.<br>
                    <br>
                    Please rest assured that despite this hiccup, I am
                    committed to ensuring the successful completion of
                    the Supermarket AI project. I am consistently
                    liaising with Victor's team to expedite the
                    resolution of the current issues and to proceed with
                    the project as swiftly as possible once these are
                    addressed. My objective, as always, is to uphold the
                    quality and timeliness of our work.<br>
                    <br>
