Dear Yamadera-san,

I deeply apologize for all the inconveniences from this project.
I think there was a big miscommunication on the progress of the project.
So far, Mark didn't share any remaining task or problem that might
constitute an obstacle to deliver the project on time.
To be honest, I was surprised when I read the email.
But as you said, I'll make sure to make it the top priority until it's done=
.

Thank you for your understanding, and my apologies again.

Best regards,
Ch=C3=A9rubin

&gt;&gt; <br>
&gt;&gt; Dear Yamadera san<br>
&gt;&gt; <br>
&gt;&gt; I understand your concern regarding the progress of the Supermarke=
t AI project, and I appreciate the opportunity to shed light on the situati=
on.<br>
&gt;&gt; <br>
&gt;&gt; I&#39;d like to clarify the roles and responsibilities within the =
project, as it seems there may be some misunderstandings. Although I&#39;ve=
 been deeply involved in the project, my scope of work is primarily focused=
 on the frontend interfaces. I&#39;m pleased to report I completed my tasks=
 before our initial deadline and have been ready to integrate them with the=
 the project&#39;s ai predicted data since then.<br>
&gt;&gt; <br>
&gt;&gt; The delay, unfortunately, stems from aspects outside of my control=
, specifically the machine learning model training, predicted data, should =
managed by Victor&#39;s team. The project is an interlinked ecosystem of ef=
forts, and without the completion of the data prediction from machine learn=
ing team, proceeding with the next steps was not feasible, hence the delay.=
<br>
&gt;&gt; <br>
&gt;&gt; Recently, I received the predicted data from the Machine Learning =
team. However, there seem to be some inaccuracies, with the predictions con=
sistently falling below actual levels. As these predictions play a critical=
 role in the seamless operation of our interfaces, it is crucial that these=
 inaccuracies are addressed by the respective team. I&#39;ve reached out to=
 Mark to query about this and am awaiting their response and rectification.=
<br>
&gt;&gt; <br>
&gt;&gt; Please rest assured that despite this hiccup, I am committed to en=
suring the successful completion of the Supermarket AI project. I am consis=
tently liaising with Victor&#39;s team to expedite the resolution of the cu=
rrent issues and to proceed with the project as swiftly as possible once th=
ese are addressed. My objective, as always, is to uphold the quality and ti=
meliness of our work.<br>
&gt;&gt; <br>
&gt;&gt; I hope this brings clarity to the situation and welcome any furthe=
r inquiries.<br>
&gt;&gt; <br>
&gt;&gt; Best regards,<br>
&gt;&gt; <br>
