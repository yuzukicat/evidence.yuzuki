      Dear Cherubin:
    </p><p>
      There have been some concerns raised by our customers regarding
      the output being developed by Machine Team. Specifically, they
      have presented us with two questions we need to address:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><code>[=C2=A0]</code> Why is the system only generating
        predictions for one month in advance?</li>
      <li><code>[=C2=A0]</code> Why are there no predictions
        available for the period ranging from August 2022 to January
        2023?</li>
    </ul><p>
      The nature of these questions suggests that the current output
      does not align with our original design, which has been clearly
      outlined in the requirement definitions. As a reminder, the
      documentation can be found at our GitHub repository at:
      <a href=3D"https://github.com/eyesjapan/google-data-studio/blob/main/=
requirement-definition.md" target=3D"_blank">https://github.com/eyesjapan/g=
oogle-data-studio/blob/main/requirement-definition.md</a>
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><code>[=C2=A0]</code> The client prefers to use Google
        Data Studio for visualization. I understand that if we encounter
        any limitations during the project, we are not responsible, as
        we are following the client&#39;s instructions.</li>
      <li><code>[=C2=A0]</code> The AI prediction for overlaying
        daily sales at specific times (e.g., 12, 15, 17) will be handled
        by Mark, not me. I will be responsible for visualizing the data
        provided by Mark, which should be in CSV format.</li>
      <li><code>[=C2=A0]</code> The selection of days with no
        significant incidents to show the difference between AI
        predictions and real results will also be provided by Mark. My
        responsibility is to present the view of the CSV data or
        results.</li>
      <li><code>[=C2=A0]</code> The same applies to the daily
        sales predictions for the three stores. I will be responsible
        for data visualization, but the data should be predicted by Mark
        first, or I will need some data examples.</li>
    </ul><p>
      Our clients rely on us to provide accurate and reliable
      predictions as per the outlined design, hence their concern. As
      part of the machine team, could you please look into these
      questions and offer an explanation or solution?
    </p><p>
      Also, please find attached the record of proceedings from our last
      meeting. This may offer some context to help.
    </p><p>
      We are counting on ML Team to help us resolve these concerns as
      swiftly as possible so we can continue to provide our customers
      with the high-quality service they expect from us.
    </p><p>
      Best regards.
