&gt;&gt; Dear Sara,<br>
&gt;&gt; <br>
&gt;&gt; I read the 45-minute transcript of your conversation with Cherubin=
 to understand the whole situation. It looks like we=E2=80=99re going back =
and forth over and over again.<br>
&gt;&gt; <br>
&gt;&gt; Let me briefly repeat the main idea of the meeting with Yamadera s=
an and you at the beginning of May (including the follow-up emails): You sh=
ould prepare the prototype in Looker Studio for the client that can visuali=
ze the sales of the provided data (from August to February) and the predict=
ed data for a short period. Mark would prepare the predicted data once you =
had provided him with the necessary format. Moreover, Yamadera san told you=
 that nobody expects the ideal predictions because the amount of data is sm=
all (and also because we didn=E2=80=99t have time and resources to apply ad=
vanced models). You were assigned to prepare the Looker Studio prototype an=
d ask Mark to provide the data in the appropriate format. I offered to help=
 answer questions and provide suggestions (but not with =E2=80=9Cleading th=
e project=E2=80=9D, since it=E2=80=99s a quick prototype). <br>
&gt;&gt; <br>
&gt;&gt; So both of your questions can be answered based on that idea:<br>
&gt;&gt; - we decided to run the prediction for one month to showcase the p=
ossibility of predicting the trends of sales. It=E2=80=99s not ideal, but i=
t repeats the general trend.<br>
&gt;&gt; - in Machine learning, you need to use some of the data for traini=
ng. That=E2=80=99s why the data from August to January is used to train the=
 model that predicts the sales in February.<br>
&gt;&gt; <br>
&gt;&gt; So what you should do now: visualize the predicted data for Februa=
ry. You told Cherubin that you received some predicted data from Edward and=
 you think that it fits better. In such a case, you can visualize Edward=E2=
=80=99s data (but ask him to explain how he got it). By the way, you haven=
=E2=80=99t shared the Looker Studio report with me yet and only recently sh=
ared it with some team members. If you had finished the prototype a long ti=
me ago, you could share it with everybody by using dummy data instead of th=
e predicted one. In such a case, your work would be completed.<br>
&gt;&gt; <br>
&gt;&gt; You can even share two reports: one with Mark=E2=80=99s data and t=
he other one with Edward=E2=80=99s, so we could compare, discuss, and make =
the decision together.<br>
&gt;&gt; <br>
&gt;&gt; If you look again at the requirements: develop a quick prototype f=
or the customers to show what is possible in Looker Studio. If they like it=
, there will be additional development of the interface, prediction model, =
etc.<br>
&gt;&gt; <br>

&gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0=E2=80=A2 [ ] The client prefers to use Goo=
gle Data Studio for visualization. I understand that if we encounter any li=
mitations during the project, we are not responsible, as we are following t=
he client&#39;s instructions.<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0=E2=80=A2 [ ] The AI prediction for overlay=
ing daily sales at specific times (e.g., 12, 15, 17) will be handled by Mar=
k, not me. I will be responsible for visualizing the data provided by Mark,=
 which should be in CSV format.<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0=E2=80=A2 [ ] The selection of days with no=
 significant incidents to show the difference between AI predictions and re=
al results will also be provided by Mark. My responsibility is to present t=
he view of the CSV data or results.<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0=E2=80=A2 [ ] The same applies to the daily=
 sales predictions for the three stores. I will be responsible for data vis=
ualization, but the data should be predicted by Mark first, or I will need =
some data examples.<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; Our clients rely on us to provide accurate and reliable predic=
tions as per the outlined design, hence their concern. As part of the machi=
ne team, could you please look into these questions and offer an explanatio=
n or solution? <br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; Also, please find attached the record of proceedings from our =
last meeting. This may offer some context to help. <br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; We are counting on ML Team to help us resolve these concerns a=
s swiftly as possible so we can continue to provide our customers with the =
high-quality service they expect from us. <br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; Best regards. <br>
