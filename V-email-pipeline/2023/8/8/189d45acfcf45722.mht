the predicted data for a short period. Mark would prepare the predicted =
data once you had provided him with the necessary format. Moreover, =
Yamadera san told you that nobody expects the ideal predictions because =
the amount of data is small (and also because we didn=E2=80=99t have =
time and resources to apply advanced models). You were assigned to =
prepare the Looker Studio prototype and ask Mark to provide the data in =
the appropriate format. I offered to help answer questions and provide =
suggestions (but not with =E2=80=9Cleading the project=E2=80=9D, since =

>>=20
>> So what you should do now: visualize the predicted data for February. =
You told Cherubin that you received some predicted data from Edward and =
you think that it fits better. In such a case, you can visualize =
Edward=E2=80=99s data (but ask him to explain how he got it). By the =
way, you haven=E2=80=99t shared the Looker Studio report with me yet and =
only recently shared it with some team members. If you had finished the =
prototype a long time ago, you could share it with everybody by using =
dummy data instead of the predicted one. In such a case, your work would =
be completed.
>>=20
>> You can even share two reports: one with Mark=E2=80=99s data and the =
other one with Edward=E2=80=99s, so we could compare, discuss, and make =
the decision together.

the customers to show what is possible in Looker Studio. If they like =
it, there will be additional development of the interface, prediction =
model, etc.
