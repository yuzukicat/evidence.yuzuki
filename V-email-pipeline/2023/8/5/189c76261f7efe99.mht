Dear Sara,

I read the 45-minute transcript of your conversation with Cherubin to =
understand the whole situation. It looks like we=E2=80=99re going back =
and forth over and over again.

Let me briefly repeat the main idea of the meeting with Yamadera san and =
you at the beginning of May (including the follow-up emails): You should =
prepare the prototype in Looker Studio for the client that can visualize =
the sales of the provided data (from August to February) and the =
predicted data for a short period. Mark would prepare the predicted data =
once you had provided him with the necessary format. Moreover, Yamadera =
san told you that nobody expects the ideal predictions because the =
amount of data is small (and also because we didn=E2=80=99t have time =
and resources to apply advanced models). You were assigned to prepare =
the Looker Studio prototype and ask Mark to provide the data in the =
appropriate format. I offered to help answer questions and provide =
suggestions (but not with =E2=80=9Cleading the project=E2=80=9D, since =
it=E2=80=99s a quick prototype).=20

So both of your questions can be answered based on that idea:
- we decided to run the prediction for one month to showcase the =
possibility of predicting the trends of sales. It=E2=80=99s not ideal, =
but it repeats the general trend.
- in Machine learning, you need to use some of the data for training. =
That=E2=80=99s why the data from August to January is used to train the =
model that predicts the sales in February.

So what you should do now: visualize the predicted data for February. =
You told Cherubin that you received some predicted data from Edward and =
you think that it fits better. In such a case, you can visualize =
Edward=E2=80=99s data (but ask him to explain how he got it). By the =
way, you haven=E2=80=99t shared the Looker Studio report with me yet and =
only recently shared it with some team members. If you had finished the =
prototype a long time ago, you could share it with everybody by using =
dummy data instead of the predicted one. In such a case, your work would =
be completed.

You can even share two reports: one with Mark=E2=80=99s data and the =
other one with Edward=E2=80=99s, so we could compare, discuss, and make =
the decision together.

If you look again at the requirements: develop a quick prototype for the =
customers to show what is possible in Looker Studio. If they like it, =
there will be additional development of the interface, prediction model, =
etc.

Best regards,
Victor Khaustov
